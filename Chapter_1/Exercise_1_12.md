# Chapter 1 - Exercise 12

## Exercise 1.12: What does the following for loop do? What is the final value of sum ?

```cpp
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)
		sum += i;
```
## Solution

It sums a number that starts form -100 and increment by one every loop until it reach 100. Therefore sum will be 0.
