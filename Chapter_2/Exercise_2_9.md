# Chapter 2 - Exercise 9

## Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

## Solution

(a) std::cin >> int input_value; 
- illegal, wrong syntax for declaration

(b) int i = { 3.14 }; 
- illegal, cannot narrow.

(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99; 
- illegal, wage hasn't declared

(d) int i = 3.14;
- legal, but will truncate due to 3.14 is a floating value
