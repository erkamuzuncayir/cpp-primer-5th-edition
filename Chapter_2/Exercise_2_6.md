# Chapter 2 - Exercise 6

## Exercise 2.6: What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:

int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;

## Solution

First ones are decimal literals.
Second ones are octal literals.
But 9 is not a octal number, so there will be difference.
