# Chapter 2 - Exercise 2

## Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

## Solution

We can use double or float for rate and payment because it's mostly a floating value.

We can use long for principal because it's mostly an integral value. We don't use integer because principal value may overcome from limits of integer.
