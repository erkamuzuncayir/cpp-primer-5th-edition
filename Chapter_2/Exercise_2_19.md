# Chapter 2 - Exercise 19

## Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

## Solution

1. References strictly bounded with object by referenced itself. Therefore it can't reassign to another object. But pointers can hold different addresses at different times.

2. Due to strictly boundness, references must be initialized but pointers didn't have to initialized.

3. Pointers itself an object but references are not.
